Backlog

Backlog: Game database

### What is Backlog?
Backlog is a solution for gamers who have too much games and can't keep track of them.

Backlog helps you answer a couple of questions:
- What games do I have?
- How many games do I still need to finish?
- How, and when, did I get that game and for how much?

### Features
- Keep track of purchases (dates, shops and prices)
- Multiple statuses (not just finished/not finished!)
- Support for DLC
- Notes for purchases, DLC or games
- Steam integration (get playtime and icons/logos from Steam!)
- Stats page
- History

##### Purchases and games
Backlog is based around a purchase model; the idea is that when you buy a game, or a bundle with games (like a indie bundle), you add a purchase. You specify where you bought it, for how much and what games it contains. One purchase can hold multiple games (this is great for keeping track of bundles!), but a game can appear in multiple purchases. This is because sometimes you buy a bundle which contains a game you already have.

##### Statuses
Every game has a status attached, like:
 - Finished
 - Untouched
 - Playing
 - Gave up (boring/too hard)
 - Unfinishable (multiplayer only)

### Used tools and libraries
Bootstrap is written in PHP. The design is based on Bootstrap with the Bootswatch Slate theme. Charts are powered by ChartJS.

### Development status
As you might have guessed, Backlog is heavily in development. There is no stable/ready for use release yet. You should regard it as WIP/alpha. A demo (also development environment) is available at http://backlog.tuxplace.nl.

This project wasn't originally intended for public distribution, but rather as an (small) school project. Hence the lack comments in the code and so on.
